1. As a park owner, I want to add and edit park attractions information:
	- Attractions name;
	- Attractions category (Fun, Utility, Restaurants, Shop, Show);
		if category is “Fun”:
			- Attractions throughput;
			- Attractions maximum age;
			- Attractions maximum height;
			- Attractions minimum height,
	- Attractions geographic location;
	- Attraction opening time,
so that park visitors can have access to this information.

2. As a park visitor who has finished queuing, I want to insert feedback that consists:
	- the time I spent in the queue;
	- the number of visitors in the queue before me,
so that the system can improve the estimated waiting time.

3. As a park visitor in the queue, I want to view the remaining waiting time in the queue, so that I can organize myself better.
